Sometimes you just need data about your systems, and you can get this data with Ansible!
Ansible can automate almost everything but one of the best tasks to start on is the gathering of infrastructure data.
You know you have servers, networks etc but trying to audit or gather all the system data can be a big exercise.
Luckly, you can use Ansible at scale for this.

Below are credentials for our Ansible Automation Platform that you should use:

|===
| Username | Password

| admin
| ansible123!

|
|
|===

Your DNS domain for this lab is: *[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]*

|===
| Server | FQDN

| Windows Server
| windows.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Node01
| node01.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Node02
| node02.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Node03
| node03.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

= ☑️ Tell me about my servers

Nagivate to your lab `aap` tab and login.
Navigate to *Automation Execution* > *Infrastructure* > Inventories.
This is where we keep track of the systems we automate, you will see a few inventories already built for you.
Select the *Video Platform Inventory*, and then select the *Hosts* tab.

We are going to use the Ansible Automation Platform's ability to run adhoc commands to gather system facts or system data.
Select the host: `node01` and then click on `Run command`.
You have a number of prompts now on what command you want to run against this host.
Select the *Setup*  module from the module drop down list and then click next.

We need to pick an execution environment to run this module.
In the Ansible Automation Platform, we use Execution Environments to launch templates/playbooks.
Select the *Default execution environment* and click next.

We will need to choose the credentials we should use for the host we want to interact with.
Select the *Application Nodes* credential and click next before click on Finish.

Once the command executes, we will be presented with the system facts.

This is all the infromation that Ansible can gather from the system,

[#morescale]
= ☑️ More info, more scale ?

We need infrastructure awareness!
and with Ansible its super easy.
We can use Ansible and jinja templates to create dynamic reports based on facts and Ansible tasks.
Lets dive in!

Navigate  to *Automation Execution* > *Templates*, and execute *Application Server Report*.
This template will prompt you with a few options, click *All*.

Once completed, navigate to the `Report Server tab` and refresh it to see the report.

Notice we also have the backups reported in this report too!

You can re-run the report template and choose other options if you want to create other reports for specific criteria.

[#compliance]
= ☑️ Is our server compliant ?

We love reports!
but do you know who else loves reports ?
Infosec!!
Well we can run an OpenSCAP compliance report as we that template available to us!
Security has asked for the compliance report for `Node02` so lets have a look!

Navigate  to *Automation Execution* > *Templates*, and execute *OpenSCAP Report*.
Once this job is completed, navigate to the `Compliance Report tab` to see the report.

You can click on the report to view the results!
