Welcome to the ServiceNow Automation with Ansible workshop. This hands-on lab will teach you how to integrate Ansible Automation Platform with ServiceNow ITSM to automate common IT service management tasks.

toc::[]

== Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the `servicenow.itsm` certified collection to automate ServiceNow operations through Ansible playbooks and job templates. You'll explore real-world scenarios that demonstrate the power of combining Ansible's automation capabilities with ServiceNow's ITSM platform.

=== What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Create and manage ServiceNow incidents using Ansible
* Implement automated problem management workflows
* Automate change request processes
* Query and update configuration items in the CMDB
* Perform automated record cleanup and maintenance
* Use ServiceNow as a dynamic inventory source for Ansible
