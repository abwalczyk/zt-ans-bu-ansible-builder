Welcome to the **Ansible Builder and Execution Environments** workshop.  
This hands-on lab teaches you how to create and customize Ansible Execution Environments (EEs) for use in Automation Controller and other Ansible Automation Platform components.

toc::[]

== Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to use **Ansible Builder** to define, build, and manage execution environments that contain the exact dependencies needed for your automation.  
Youâ€™ll also learn how Ansible Builder integrates with **Automation Hub**, **Automation Controller**, and **private registries** to streamline automation at scale.

=== What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Understand the purpose and structure of Execution Environments
* Build a custom EE using `ansible-builder`
* Include additional Python and system dependencies
* Reference private Automation Hub collections
* Use build arguments to handle certificates and secure registries
* Troubleshoot and optimize your EE build process
* Push and use the resulting EE in Automation Controller

=== Workshop Modules

This workshop is organized into six progressive modules:

== Lab Environment

=== Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:

* Basic understanding of Ansible concepts and playbooks
* Familiarity with Automation Controller and Automation Hub
* Access to the provided lab environment

=== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is already logged into the lab environment as the `{ssh_user}` user via SSH.  
All steps in this lab should be completed as the `{ssh_user}` user.

You have access to the following components:

* **VS Code**: Integrated environment for editing EE definition files
* **Ansible Builder**: Installed and ready for use
* **Automation Hub**: Private hub with certified and validated collections
* **Podman/Buildah**: Container tools for building and running EEs
* **Automation Controller**: Configured to consume built EEs

=== Getting Started

To begin the workshop:

1. Open VS Code in your workspace
2. Review the `execution-environment.yml` and supporting files
3. Build your first EE using `ansible-builder build`
4. Explore the build context and output logs to understand each layer

[TIP]
====
You can re-run your build with increasing verbosity using the `-v` option:
`ansible-builder build -v 3`

This is useful for debugging missing dependencies, certificate issues, or Hub authentication problems.
