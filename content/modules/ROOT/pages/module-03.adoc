Another great report to generate is a patching report!
Our Windows server is sure to need some patches but we dont have access to the system.
So lets get Ansible to get the required patches and we can provide this back to our Windows team.

Below are credentials for our Ansible Automation Platform that you should use:

|===
| Username | Password

| admin
| ansible123!

|
|
|===

Your DNS domain for this lab is: *[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]*

|===
| Server | FQDN

| Windows Server
| windows.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Node01
| node01.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Node02
| node02.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Node03
| node03.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

= ☑️ We need a patch report

We can gather all the details and then create a report using jinja templates again.
We will even post the report as a web page on our Windows host!

Navigate  to *Automation Execution* > *Templates*, and select *Windows Update Report*.
Before we can launch it we need to create a survey so we can decide which updates we are looking for.

Navigate to the `Survey` tab and add the following details:

NOTE: To add each multiple choice option you will need fill in the field and then click on the + to add it to the list.

 Question: Which update catagory are you wanting to search for?
 Description: Windows Update Catagory
 Answer variable name: update_catagory
 Answer type: Multiple Choice (single select)
 Multiple Choice Options: Security Updates, Critical Updates, Tools, Definition Updates, Updates

You can then click on *Create survey question*.
Make sure you enable the Survey at the top of the pane with the toggle.

Once enabled, we can now launch the template and select *Security Updates* from the drop down list.

Once the template has completed, navigate to the `Windows Report` tab.
You should be presented with the outstanding update that is needed for this system.

Well done!
you have just automated a number of backups and you have gathered data and presented it as a report for your team!
all without affecting production and with Ansible!

[#lastCheck]
= ☑️ Last check!

Before we finish off, navigate  to *Automation Execution* > *Jobs* and observe that your Server Backup -VSS/Windows jobs that you have scheduled earlier have run.
You can also run the template Check Windows Backups to see if you have some VSS snapshots!
