= Get Started With Ansible-builder
:toc:
:toc-placement!:

This repository contains learning materials and automation scripts for creating, customizing, and managing **Execution Environments (EEs)** using **Ansible Builder** in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

toc::[]

== Overview

This workshop demonstrates how to use **Ansible Builder** to automate the process of building and maintaining execution environments — portable, containerized runtimes that package everything Ansible needs to run your automation reliably across systems.

You will learn how to:

* Understand the structure and purpose of Execution Environments
* Create and customize EEs using `ansible-builder`
* Add Python, system, and collection dependencies
* Integrate with private Automation Hub instances
* Handle custom SSL certificates and registry authentication
* Test and publish your EEs to Automation Controller

== Getting Started

The workshop content is organized into six modules:

1. **Introduction to Execution Environments** - Understand what EEs are and why they matter
2. **Using Ansible Builder** - Create and inspect your first EE build context
3. **Adding Dependencies** - Include system, Python, and collection dependencies
4. **Working with Automation Hub** - Configure access to private repositories and tokens
5. **Handling Certificates and Auth** - Manage secure connections and cert validation
6. **Publishing and Testing** - Push your EE to a registry and use it in Automation Controller

== Prerequisites

* Access to Ansible Automation Platform or AWX
* Installed `ansible-builder` and `podman` (or `buildah`)
* Access to a private Automation Hub (or Red Hat Certified Content)
* Basic understanding of Ansible playbooks and collections
* Familiarity with YAML file structures

== Lab Environment

The lab environment includes:

* **VS Code** – Preconfigured workspace for editing EE files
* **Ansible Builder** – Installed and ready to use
* **Automation Hub** – Source for collections and dependencies
* **Podman/Buildah** – Tools for container image building
* **Automation Controller** – For testing and running jobs with custom EEs

[TIP]
====
You can use verbosity flags for deeper insight during builds:

`ansible-builder build -v 3`

This helps troubleshoot issues like missing collections, failed downloads, or invalid certificates.
